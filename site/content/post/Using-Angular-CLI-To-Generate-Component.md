title: Using Angular CLI To Generate Component
---
Typescript has more features than vanilla JS.  eg Types, Classes, Interfaces, etc.
A component is just a class.  We have to export our class.  The naming convention is very important such as AppComponent.

We can also create new components using Angular CLI.  We can see in the following video that we can use the following:
<ul>
  <li>1. ng generate compononent name</li>
  <li>2. ng g c name </li>
</ul>
