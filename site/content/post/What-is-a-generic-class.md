title: What is a generic class Dot.NET
---
At its core, a generic class is a special class that allows you to define a class with placeholders for the type of its fields, methods, parameters, etc.  Generics replace these placeholders with some specific type at compile time.  Generics were first introduced in C# 2.0.
 
A generic class can be defined using angle brackets <>. For example, the following is a simple generic class with a generic member variable, generic method and property.
